PS: when this is merged, any chance it's also backported (it's 100% compatible) to the `3.0.x` "branch" as well? It's a huge problem here, and 3.1.x is not compatible with the latest stable symfony & flex.

I also have an issue with this. The fix works fine.

We have the same problem.

If you use enviroment vars for configuration then you get following exception:

```
Swift_TransportException: Unsupported sendmail command flags []. Must be one of "-bs" or "-t" but can include additional flags. in /srv/share/api/vendor/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/lib/classes/Swift/Transport/SendmailTransport.php:149
```
