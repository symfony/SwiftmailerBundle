LGTM but we need to fix the low deps build... dunno why it fails for `3.4@dev` but not for `3.3@dev`

@ro0NL could you add the static `$defaultName` to these commands? hope tests turn green magically

Lets see :)

Seems like it did not... dunno :/

@chalasr `3.3@dev` also doesnt work, currently the constraint has a lower bound on 2.7. So deps=low happily installs symfony/symfony 2.8.*@dev.

Not sure what to do :)  perhaps in master `SYMFONY_VERSION` needs an update =/

@fabpot do you have any idea about what to do regarding the test suite? It can't checkout console 3.4 in `deps=low` as it conflicts with `symfony/symfony:2.8.*`.

@chalasr looks like composer is passing :)

I believe this is compatible with 2.7 + dev-3.4. Ill let @fabpot decide if we want to keep the lower bounds in composer ;-)

Failures related to upper bounds;

```
Fetching the "swiftmailer.mailer.default.transport" private alias is deprecated and will fail in Symfony 4.0. Make the alias public instead: 6x
```

@fabpot i used `static::$defaultName` BTW. Due protected/non final state.
