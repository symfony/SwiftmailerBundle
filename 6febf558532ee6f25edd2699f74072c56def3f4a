what would be the behavior on older versions ?

In the old Symfony versions, this panel will appear before any panel which doesn't define the priority (most of them) or define a priority lower than 260 (all of them). For some users it may be confusing because they are used to certain panel order.

Coudln't we use 255 or 254, to keep it after core panels in Symfony 2.7 and older (they are at 255) ?

Good idea! I've used `250` for Doctrine and `245` for SwiftMailer. This should work right in any Symfony version.

I'm just waiting for Travis to run (but the Travis quota is per repo owner, and symfony/symfony has a bunch of queued builds right now)
